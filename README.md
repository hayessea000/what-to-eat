# what-to-eat

## Description 

We set off to build a website that can help a user find a meal using simple search criteria utilizing API technology.

## Technologies Utilized

the page utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery, Bulma

## What we learned

We learned to build a fully responsive website to search and find meals and recipes easily

## Task

GIVEN I am using a search tool to find a meal to eat
WHEN I search for meals or recipes
THEN I am presented with a variety of different meals that pertain to my search criteria
WHEN I click the show recipe button on a recipe
THEN The ingredient list and recipe will drop down
WHEN I click return to results
THEN The search results will display
WHEN I click the save button 
THEN My recipe will display on the left margin of the webpage
WHEN I refresh the webpage
THEN The saved recipes persist

## Struggles

The biggest struggles we ran into as a group in this project were learning, and utilizing new technologies for our website, varying degrees of experience and knowledge writing code and working in a developer mindset. Balancing workload across different files to minimize merge conflicts etc. Finding and utilizing strong points in team members. Transitioning from working generally alone to a team environment. 

## Usage

The webpage will load saved recipes from previous uses. Previously saved recipes will display on the left margin, they will display as they normally would when using the webpage
